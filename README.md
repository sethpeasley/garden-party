Code to monitor and control a hydroponic garden.


This project outlines the code and hardware setup for a friend's hydroponic garden. She is growing vegetables in her basement to increase her nutritive variety and also to get her tomatoes out before her dad.

This project will focus on the Arduino microcontroller and the Beaglebone Black, because those are devices with which I am familiar, and that I currently have.
